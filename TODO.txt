# refactor:
  clean up Clone->Node mess!!! (Node should be a templated class)
  Clone::is_visible -> Node::is_visible
  Clone::setParent(Clone*) -> Node::setParent(Node*)
  remove un-needed CloneTree class

# avoid masked positions ('N', lower case letters?) from being mutated

# VCF output: flag private mutations
